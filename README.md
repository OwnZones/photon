# IMPORTANT NOTE
This is an experimental fork of Photon implementing extensions to validate IMF App#5 ACES packages.
These extensions are experimental, work-in-progress and not intended for production.

You can find the Original Photon software [here](https://github.com/netflix/photon).

# How to use
The IMPAnalyzer now supports the following option:
```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: com.netflix.imflibrary.app.IMPAnalyzer <directory>
```
```
options:            
-a, --application APPSTRING      IMF Application to test against, supported values for APPSTRING are app2or2E, app5 or all (default: app2or2E)
```

Limitation:
The option "-a" is currently supported for the ```<package_directory>``` argument only.

Please note, by default Photon tests against the App #2/#2E specification.

# Photon

Photon is a Java implementation of the Interoperable Master Format (IMF) standard. IMF is a SMPTE standard whose core constraints are defined in the specification st2067-2:2013. Photon offers tools for parsing, interpreting and validating constituent files that make an Interoperable Master Package (IMP). These include AssetMap (st429-9:2014), PackingList (st429-8:2007), Composition Playlist (st2067-3:2013), and the essence containing IMF track file (st2067-5:2013) which follows the Material eXchange Format (MXF) format (st377-1:2011). Specifically, Photon parses and completely reads an MXF file containing a single audio or video essence as defined by the IMF Essence Component specification (st2067-5:2013) and serializes the metadata into the IMF Composition Playlist structure.

The goal of the Photon is to provide a simple standardized interface to completely validate an IMP.

## Build

### JDK requirements

Photon can be built using JDK-8. Support for earlier jdk versions has not been tested and/or verified.

### Gradle
Photon can be built very easily by using the included Gradle wrapper. Having downloaded the sources, simply invoke the following commands inside the folder containing the sources:

$ ./gradlew clean
$ ./gradlew build

For Windows
$ gradlew.bat clean
$ gradlew.bat build

## Binaries
Binaries and dependency information for Maven, Ivy, Gradle and others can be found at [http://search.maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.photon%22).

Change history and version numbers are available at [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Netflix/photon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Example for Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.photon</groupId>
    <artifactId>Photon</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```
and for Ivy:

```xml

```

If you need to download all dependencies, you just have to run:

```
$ ./gradlew getDependencies
```

It will download all dependencies into ./build/libs directory, where Photon.*.jar is built. Multiple sample applications have been provided with this project (e.g., com.netflix.imflibrary.app.IMFTrackFileReader). Having obtained the dependencies, you can run an application as follows:

```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: <fully qualified class name> <zero or more arguments>
```
E.g.,
```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: com.netflix.imflibrary.st0429_9.AssetMap asset_map_file_path
```
```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: com.netflix.imflibrary.st0429_8.PackingList packing_list_file_path
```
```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: com.netflix.imflibrary.st2067_2.Composition composition_playlist_file_path
```
```
java -cp ./build/libs/*: com.netflix.imflibrary.app.IMPAnalyzer IMP_folder_path
```
